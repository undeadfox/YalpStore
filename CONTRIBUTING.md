### Questions

If you have a question or want to discuss something which is not a bug or a feature request, please use [the gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/YalpStore/Lobby).

### Bugs and feature requests

Please, [search the closed issues](https://github.com/yeriomin/YalpStore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) before creating a bug or a feature request.

Also, please make sure you are using the latest version available through [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore).

Keep in mind that naming an issue is important for future searches. Naming it "Bug" or "A request" is unhelpful.
